******** UNFINISHED ***********
After trying Firebase as a auth method I don't like how it works and I would like to have more freedom, so I will make a version 2 of this project with a custom backend/custom auth methods. 
This will allow me to have a better control on currentUsers

Things I dont like about Firebase (I didnt find a solution for these problems. There might be one, but its well hidden)
- I cant manually modify user account data
- With Phone Auth I want more freedom / I want to use it to verify an account and not as an access method
- Most of the documentation is deprecated
